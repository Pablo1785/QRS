Technical notes:
1. do R-peak matching using Q-R-S sample IDs OR use the same filter as Muzaffer on the signal and use those R-peaks
2. include training accuracy in tensorboard
3. save model architecture + preprocessing pipeline + input/output dimensions + annotate the links/reports with accuracy and duration

Approaches:
1. try moving average + signal  (reach into other beats when calculating on the edges of beat slices)
2. try moving average
3. try only the points - we are trying to save data transfer; try embedding them using the link from Teams https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021001394
4. try only the points - use binary masks
